# etch-a-sketch
A fun little sketch pad, built with a ton of DOM manipulation.

Has three modes available: regular sketch pad mode, where squares are highlited pink as they are traced through, a rainbow mode which colors squaraes with random colors, and a fade mode which increases the opacity on a square the more you hover through it
